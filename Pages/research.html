											<h3>
												Quantum Information Theory
											</h3>
											We are interested in quantum systems with initial correlations, non-Markovianity and its effects on experiments. For instance, let us consider spectroscopy. The relationship between the controls available to a spectroscopist and the signal output is typically calculated in the limit of vanishing correlations between the system and the environment. In this limit, typical Markovian master equations are derived and used routinely in weak-field phase control spectroscopy, 2D spectroscopy etc. We are interested in using these experimental toolboxes to go beyond such physics. <br><br>

											<h3>
												Quantum Synchronisation
											</h3>
											Synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed in a plethora of systems. At its core it can be viewed as "adjustment of rhythms" of self-sustaining or chaotic systems due to either external drive (entrainment) or mutual coupling between the systems (synchronisation). We are interested in understanding and observing synchronisation in the quantum regime and applying it to quantum technologies.<br><br>
